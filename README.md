# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of vehicles based on features such as brand, mileage, engine specs, transmission type, fuel type, and more. My goal was to understand the full ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment-ready evaluation.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Exploration
Used a cleaned dataset with features relevant to vehicle pricing (make, model, mileage, fuel type, etc.).

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, missing values, outliers, and feature correlations.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values using strategies like mean/median imputation.

Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding (get_dummies) for non-ordinal features.

Normalized/standardized numerical features where necessary.

Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns to reduce noise.

# Why Random Forest?
I chose Random Forest Regressor for its:

Robustness to overfitting, thanks to ensemble learning and bagging.

Ability to handle both numerical and categorical data efficiently.

Feature importance scoring, which helps interpret which variables most influence price.

Good baseline performance without heavy hyperparameter tuning.

# Evaluation Metrics
RÂ² Score: To assess how well the model explains price variability.

MAE & RMSE: To evaluate average prediction error.

Cross-validated performance to ensure generalization.

# Key Learnings
Deepened understanding of the machine learning pipeline, from cleaning data to evaluating model performance.

Improved skills in feature engineering, encoding strategies, and selecting appropriate models.

Gained insights into the trade-offs between bias and variance while tuning models.

Understood the importance of preprocessing for real-world, messy datasets.

# next steps
Try other models like XGBoost or LightGBM and compare performance.

Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

Explore deployment via Flask or Streamlit.
